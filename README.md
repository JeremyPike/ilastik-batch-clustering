# Fiji macro for batch segmentation and post-processing using an ilastik pixel classfier

If you have any questions please contact j.a.pike@bham.ac.uk

The macro batch processes all images in a folder and runs an ilastik pixel classifier to split the images into three classes (background, cell and clustered receptor). Post-processing extracts the area of each class as well as the mean area of individual clusters.

To run this macro you need to install ilastik and the Fiji ilastik plugin.
